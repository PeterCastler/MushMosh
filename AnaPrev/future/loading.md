# **1. Progressive Playback**
• Initially display a blurred version of the first still frame of the video for the user's reassurance.
• Enable playback once we have enough frames buffered (e.g., first 1/3)
• Continue loading in background (if possible)
• Lock seeking beyond the loaded portion
• Show a visual indicator of how much is loaded (like YouTube's gray/red buffer bar)

• Show estimated time remaining
• Display current activity (e.g., "Decoding frame 1000/23400")
• Show memory usage stats

• Show first frame immediately (blurred as you suggested)
• Could even show a low-res thumbnail strip while loading (like video editors)
• Fade from blur to clear as frames load
• Show frame thumbnails at regular intervals in the timeline

# **4. Smart Loading**
• Start loading from current playhead position first (if possible)
• Load nearby frames in both directions (if possible)
• Load the rest in background (if possible)
• Prioritize loading visible timeline region first (if possible)

• Switch to streaming mode instead
• Show clear cancel button
• Remember preference for future loads
