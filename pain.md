# AnaPrev Video Player Issues

[2024.05.13.15:30:00] - tried: Basic timeline implementation with position tracking based on frame count and frame rate --> error: Timeline playhead stuck at far right, incorrect duration display.
[2024.05.13.16:00:00] - tried: Improved duration detection with multiple fallback methods (stream metadata, container metadata, bitrate estimation) --> error: Still showing incorrect duration values (510+ hours for short videos).
[2024.05.13.16:30:00] - tried: Added validation and sanity checks for duration and position values, capping at 24 hours --> error: Timeline slider still not updating correctly during playback.
[2024.05.13.17:00:00] - tried: Fixed slider position calculation with bounds checking --> error: Timeline functionality still not working as expected.
[2024.05.13.17:30:00] - tried: Implemented direct FFmpeg progress monitoring with separate thread --> SUCCESS: Timeline now works correctly.

The solution was to completely decouple position tracking from frame processing. Previous approaches tried to calculate position based on frame count, which was unreliable due to variable frame delivery rates and buffering. The successful approach uses wall-clock time in a separate thread to track playback position, which is much more robust and matches how professional media players work. This also fixed the duration display issues by using clearer output formats from FFmpeg and adding better error handling.
